# Hospital-management-System
 Created a hospital management system which on running will first display a welcome screen where hospital name and current date and time would be mentioned . The program would ask for a username and password and if successfully cleared then it will take us to the page where it will give us two options 1.Vaccination 2.Covid patient treatment. If the user selects the first option then it will take us to choose an option from the table. The options would be 1.Add record 2.Edit record 3.Generate a vaccination certificate. If the user choose the option covid patient treatment then it would ask the user to select options from the table that are 1.Add record 2.Edit record 3.Search record 4.View record 5.Delete record
